- nicer errors (from parser and for "command not found")
- save history
- {a,b} expansion, a kind of globbing
- report non-zero status codes
- within-argument quotes, e.g. --foo="bar"
- $-variable expansion (do we want this?)
- symlink-aware cwd with "cd .."
- "help" command
- setting environment variables via "foo=bar command"

Done:
- pipelines
- filename completion
- globbing
- cd
- signal safe (don't die on ctrl-c)
  - disabled SIGINT.  not ideal: this won't cancel the current readline
- job control
- backgrounding
- ~ expansion
- fd redirection
  - some redirection syntaxes remain to be done
- prompts
  - but not configurable
